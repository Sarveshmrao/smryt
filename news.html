                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">“Millions” of Instagram users had their passwords stored in unencrypted form on internal servers, Facebook said Thursday, raising its original estimate of tens of thousands.
<br>
<br>“We discovered additional logs of Instagram passwords being stored in a readable format. We now estimate that this issue impacted millions of Instagram users,” Facebook said in a blog post.
<br>
<br>“We will be notifying these users as we did the others. Our investigation has determined that these stored passwords were not internally abused or improperly accessed,” the social network said.
<br>
<br>Facebook, Instagram’s parent company, revealed last month that the unencrypted passwords of hundreds of millions of users had been stored, putting the number of Instagram users affected in the tens of thousands.
<br>
<br>The social network’s handling of user data has been a flashpoint for controversy since it admitted last year that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, used an app that may have hijacked the private details of 87 million users.
<br>
<br>Facebook has announced a series of moves to tighten handling of data, including eliminating most of its data-sharing partnerships with outside companies.
<br>
<br>The California firm reaches an estimated 2.7 billion people with its core social network, Instagram and messaging applications.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Canonical has rolled out a new version of its Ubuntu software. The latest iteration, version 19.04, comes with a range of new features along with improvements to performance and display. The latest version of Ubuntu can be downloaded the company’s official website.
<br>
<br>Ubuntu 19.04 is focused on open infrastructure deployments, internet of things, and cloud. The new version features latest from platforms such as OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Ceph. This also includes advanced life-cycle management for multi-cloud and on-prem operations from cloud platforms such as VMWare.
<br>
<br>For internet of things and robotics, Ubuntu’s latest iteration adds support for Amazon’s AWS DeepRacer platform. “The Edge X stack and a wide range of industrial control capabilities are now available for integration on Ubuntu based devices, with long term security updates. Multiple smart display solutions are also available as off-the-shelf components in the snap store,” said the company in a blog post.
<br>
<br>The latest Ubuntu version also offers new features to end users. This includes GNOME 3.32 which promises faster frame rates, icon load times, and more fluid startup animations. Canonical said the latest version also reduces load on processor and GPU.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), one of the oldest instant messaging apps for phones, is finally shutting down. The consumer version of BBM will stop working from May 31.
<br>
<br>Launched in 2005 by Research in Motion (later rebranded as BlackBerry), BBM was an instant hit among BlackBerry users. The instant messaging app allowed BlackBerry users to share emojis, stickers, photos, and texts. BBM is also considered as the original “mobile-first” instant messaging platform.
<br>
<br>After Apple’s iPhones and Android smartphones became more popular, both BlackBerry and BBM lost major user base. Users flocked to other cross-platform and smarter apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.
<br>
<br>In 2013, BlackBerry rolled out BBM to iOS and Android platforms. This was the first time BBM was made available on non-BlackBerry devices. The app was downloaded over 10 million times in just a day of its release on Google and Apple platforms. After short-lived buzz, BBM’s popularity continued to fade.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Apple on Thursday announced to expand its global recycling programmes and introduced Daisy, its recycling robot that is capable of disassembling 200 iPhones per hour.
<br><br>US customers can send their iPhones to be disassembled by Daisy which is 33 feet long, has five arms and can methodically deconstruct any of 15 iPhone models.
<br><br>Daisy will disassemble and recycle select used iPhones returned to Best Buy stores throughout the US and KPN retailers in the Netherlands, the company said in a statement ahead of Earth Day that falls on April 22.
<br><br>Apple also announced the opening of its “Material Recovery Lab” dedicated to discovering future recycling processes in Austin, Texas.
<br><br>The Lab will work with Apple engineering teams as well as academia to address and propose solutions to today’s industry recycling challenges.
<br><br>“Advanced recycling must become an important part of the electronics supply chain, and Apple is pioneering a new path to help push our industry forward,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives.
<br>Daisy can take apart iPhones to recover materials such as cobalt, aluminum and tin, which are then recycled back into the manufacturing process.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Giving chatbots a human name or adding human like features to it might not be enough to win over a user if the device fails to maintain a conversational back-and-forth with the person, say researchers, including one of Indian-origin.
<br>
<br>The findings, published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, suggest that chatbots that had human features such as a human avatar but which lacked interactivity, disappointed the users.
<br>
<br>“People are pleasantly surprised when a chatbot with low anthropomorphism -- fewer human cues -- has higher interactivity,” said study co-author S. Shyam Sundar, Professor at the Pennsylvania State University.
<br>
<br>“But when there are high anthropomorphic visual cues, it may set up your expectations for high interactivity - and when the chatbot doesn’t deliver that - it may leave you disappointed,” Sundar added. The researchers also found that just mentioning whether a human or a machine is involved or providing an identity cue guides how people perceive the interaction.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">WhatsApp has been working on implementing biometric authentication for Android phones. The latest WhatsApp beta update on Google Play Store shows a new development for biometric authentication.
<br>
<br>As WABetaInfo notes, enabling biometric authentication on Android will block conversation screenshots. The description in the feature titled ‘Fingerprint security’ reads, “When enabled, fingerprint is required to open WhatsApp and conversation screenshots are blocked.”
<br>
<br>This essentially means that those who use fingerprint sensor to lock/unlock WhatsApp will not be allowed to take screenshots of chats. Biometric authentication is still not available for WhatsApp users, and even public beta users. There’s no confirmation on whether this new update will come with biometric authentication. WhatsApp on iPhones already supports Face ID/Touch ID recognition. But there’s no restriction as such that blocks users from taking screenshots of chats on WhatsApp. Once WhatsApp enables fingerprint recognition on Android, we’ll get to know.
<br>
<br>On Android phones, users will find biometric authentication from Settings &gt; Account &gt; Privacy. WhatsApp will also give users options to automatically lock WhatsApp after 1 minute, 10 minutes, 30 minutes or immediately. If WhatsApp doesn’t recognise the fingerprint and there are too many failed attempts, WhatsApp will be locked for a few minutes.
<br>
<br>This beta update on WhatsApp also brought some changes to the sticker tab. WhatsApp now categorises stickers and emoji side by side. The stickers tab also has sub-sections like recents, content stickers, shapes and favourites. Stickers and emoji can be viewed in one single page. At present, emoji, GIF and stickers are placed separately on WhatsApp.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The TikTok community is very much active in India despite an “interim” ban and the platform is relying on both technology and a “huge” content moderation team to prevent misuse, a top company executive said on Thursday.
<br>The Chinese short video-sharing app, which claims that it has over 120 million monthly active users in India, is facing criticism for endangering the safety of children.
Google and Apple blocked the app, following a request from the government.
<br><br>“Currently I think it is an interim ban. We are very positive that we will get a favourable response from the government,” Sumedhas Rajgopal, Strategy and Entertainment Lead, TikTok India, told IANS.
<br>“For us, the app is still functioning. The TikTok community is still active,” Rajgopal added.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had asked Google and Apple to block the app following the Supreme Court’s refusal to stay the original Madras High Court order on April 3. The apex court said it would hear the matter on April 22.<br></p>

<br>Besides Jio, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has also received a clutch of other applications including those from Ortus Communications, Station Satcom and Cloud Cast Digital, sources privy to the development told PTI.
<br>
<br>Reliance Jio, however, declined to comment on a questionnaire sent in this regard.
<br>
<br>Sources, meanwhile, said that in some of the cases including that of Ortus Communications, the DoT has sought some clarification on the application submitted.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Apple fans may have to wait longer for first 5G iPhones. Despite Apple and Qualcomm settling a two-year-old legal dispute, the Cupertino-based company may take one more year to roll out first 5G-powered iPhones.
<br>According to a Nikkei report, Apple will use Qualcomm’s 5G chips in its future iPhones but the feature won’t come to the iPhones scheduled to launch later this year. “It is too late for Apple to use Qualcomm’s chips this year, but for 2020 it will purchase modem chips, including 5G modem chips, from the chipmaker for iPhones after finalizing the deal,” the report quotes a source as saying.
<br>The delay will put Apple behind the likes of Samsung and Huawei which have already launched 5G-based smartphones. Smaller players like Xiaomi and OnePlus have also confirmed plans to launch 5G smartphones in coming weeks. The 5G race is said to be one of the key reasons behind Apple’s decision to resolve the dispute with Qualcomm. Interestingly enough, Apple’s partner Intel announced exiting the 5G mobile chip business shortly after Apple and Qualcomm struck multi-year deal.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Users of Android devices will be able to choose their browsers and search engines from five options starting on Thursday, a senior Google executive said, in a move aimed at addressing EU antitrust concerns and staving off fresh sanctions.
<br>
<br>Hit with a record 4.34 billion euro fine last year for using the market power of its mobile software to block rivals in areas such as internet browsing, Alphabet unit Google was also ordered to come up with a proposal to give its rivals a fair chance.
<br>
<br>The European Commission said Google had an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.
<br>
<br>The company last month said it would let Android users choose their browser and search engine but did not provide details. Android users in Europe who open Google’s app store Google Play will now see new screens with an option to download different search apps and browsers, Paul Gennai, its product management director, said in a blog.</p>

Xiaomi sort of disrupted the budget smartphone segment in India with its latest Redmi Note 7 series. The company launched the Redmi Note 7 and the Redmi Note 7 Pro in India in February. Now we have the Redmi Note 7 in the house. Redmi Note 7 Pro you'll notice that I emphasized a lot on how Xiaomi changed the design of the phone to make it look a bit more upmarket, apart from focussing on better camera and core performance hardware.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Disney didn’t make announcements about other platforms because they “haven’t made deals with all of them yet.” Walt Disney Co’s new streaming service will come to Apple Inc’s TV box, even as the iPhone maker plans to start a rival offering later this year. The new Disney+ app will “in all likelihood be available through traditional app distributors, Apple being one of them,” Disney chief Bob Iger said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang. While the studio behind “Star Wars” and Marvel movies said during an earlier presentation that consumers will be able to subscribe on Roku and PlayStation, it held back from naming others.</p>

Millions more are reluctant to invite the devices and their powerful microphones into their homes out of concern that someone might be listening. Sometimes, someone is.Amazon.com Inc employs thousands of people around the world to help improve the Alexa digital assistant powering its line of Echo speakers. The team listens to voice recordings captured in Echo owners’ homes and offices. The recordings are transcribed, annotated and then fed back into the software as part of an effort to eliminate gaps in Alexa’s understanding of human speech and help it better respond to commands.</p>

The ban comes into effect from Thursday, he said.
<br>Following a request from the Himalayan nation’s federal investigation authority, the regulator directed all internet service providers, mobile operators and network service providers to block streaming of the game from Thursday onwards, Adhikari said.

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">PewDiePie’s diss tracks against T-Series are not available on YouTube following a court order in India.
<br>PewDiePie and T-Series have long been battling for the top spot on YouTube. The online battle has now taken a new turn after PewDiePie pulled two of its videos from YouTube following a Delhi High Court order.
<br>Delhi HC has ordered the removal of PewDiePie’s diss tracks against T-Series namely ‘Congratulations’ and ‘Bitch lasagna’, Bar and Bench reports. YouTube has also been ordered to see that these videos are not uploaded on the platform again. If you search for either of the videos on YouTube, you will see that they are not available in India.
<br>T-Series argued that the diss tracks contained defamatory remarks against Indians. However, PewDiePie said that all this was “done in good fun” and that he wouldn’t upload any such videos again. The YouTuber went ahead and uploaded ‘Congratulations’ on March 31 which featured similar language. In this song, PewDiePie “congratulates” T-Series on becoming the top YouTube channel while accusing on T-Series selling pirated music at the same time.
<br>The High Court was of the opinion that the songs have “repeated comments made which are abusive, vulgar and also racist in nature,” according to the report. The matter is currently pending in the Delhi High Court and the next hearing will take place on July 15.
<br>PewDiePie’s top position on YouTube was threatened after T-Series came close to his subscriber count. The Swedish YouTuber has ever since campaigned to retain his position. T-Series started surpassing PewDiePie’s subscriber count earlier this year. The Indian music label even held the throne for the longest time ever in March.
<br>Both YouTube channels are currently leading with over 93 million subscribers.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">WhatsApp is working on a feature which keeps chats archived even when a new message arrives.
<br>WhatsApp recently rolled out a feature to prevent others from adding users to groups without their permission. WhatsApp is now working on new features that will allow users to completely ignore chats on the app.
<br>The new features are an update to archived chats on WhatsApp. First spotted by WABetaInfo, these features are available in WhatsApp’s Google Play Beta Programme, but not yet for public beta users. WhatsApp improves archived chats by giving the feature more visibility and more control as well. Archived chats have been introduced in the main menu section of the app.
<br>Tapping on the three dotted menu pulls a menu for new group, new group, WhatsApp Web and more. Here, archived chats will also be available and users can tap on it see chats they have archived.
<br>The second update coming to archived chats is “Vacation Mode”, a feature introduced last October. According to the latest report WhatsApp will call this feature “Ignore Archived Chats”. Archived chats on WhatsApp are moved to the bottom of the app but a new message brings it back up. The new feature keeps the archived chats at the bottom, until the user disables it manually.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>Samsung on Wednesday launched Galaxy A80 with rotating camera module. Galaxy A80 is also the company’s first ever phone with a motorised slider-rotating hybrid setup. But Samsung isn’t the only company to experiment with a phone with a rotating shooter.
<br>Back in 2014, Oppo claimed the crown of the world’s first smartphone with rotating cameras. It launched Oppo N1 with a slider mechanism on the top panel which could be used as selfie camera as well as rear camera. The phone tried to cater to then growing demands of selfie cameras being as good as rear cameras.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The survey asked 30,000 participants, majorly from Tier-1 and 2 cities and belonging to the age group of 18-35 years across the country, whether they think TikTok should be banned in India.
<br>Eight out of 10 millenials living in India want the controversial Chinese video app TikTok to be banned, reveals a survey by news app Inshorts.
<br>This comes after the Madras High Court last week advised the Central government to ban the app.
<br>The court said that inappropriate content was being provided by the TikTok app, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, and the government had a social responsibility to stop it.
<br>TikTok on the other hand, said it was committed to abiding by local laws and regulations.
<br>“We fully comply with the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011. We are currently awaiting the official order by the Madras High Court and once received, we will review and take appropriate action regarding this matter,” the company told IANS.
<br>“In order to better coordinate with the law enforcement agencies, we have appointed a Chief Nodal Officer based out of India,” it added.
<br>The survey asked 30,000 participants, majorly from Tier-1 and 2 cities and belonging to the age group of 18-35 years across the country, whether they think TikTok should be banned in India. While 80% said yes, 20% said no, the results showed.
<br>With a global user base of over one billion users, TikTok has over 50 million users in India. In January, 43% of the app’s new users were from India, compared to just 9.5 percent in January of 2018, said Sensor Tower founder Oliver Yeh in a recent blog post. In fact, 25% of TikTok’s downloads to date have come from India, for an estimated total of 250 million there. The app enables its users to shoot short videos and share it with others.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>Removing USB drives can be tricky. If not done correctly, your files may be corrupted and even hamper performance of your device in longer term. But this process can be slow and probably the reason users don’t care about it much. Microsoft is finally addressing this issue with its latest 1809 update of Windows 10.
<br>Windows has defined two main policies for removing external storage devices - Quick removal and Better performance. The first option, as the name suggests, allows you to quickly remove the thumb drive or Thunderbolt-enabled external drive and bypass safely remove hardware process.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">OnePlus has begun preparations for the launch of OnePlus 7. Here’s everything we know about the new OnePlus smartphone.
<br>OnePlus has reportedly slashed prices of its OnePlus 6T smartphones in China. The smartphone is now available at a starting price of CNY 2,999 after a price cut of CNY 400.
<br>OnePlus 6T is available in China in four colour options including Midnight Black, Thunder Purple, Speed Orange, and Mirror Black. The 6GB RAM with 128GB storage model costs CNY 2999 whereas the top-end model featuring 8GB RAM and 128GB storage is priced at CNY 3,199. Most of the OnePlus 6T variants have received the price cut.
<br>The price drop is seen as OnePlus’ efforts to clear the stock before it launches its next flagship phone, OnePlus 7. According to GSMArena, reduction in OnePlus 6T prices could be China’s recent tax rules on luxury goods including smartphones. Just last week, Apple slashed iPhone rates in China.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>Technology firms including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter face “substantial” fines or a UK ban under a new law if they don’t act swiftly enough to remove content that encourages terrorism. The companies’ directors could also be held personally liable if illegal content is not taken down within a short and pre-determined time-frame, the Home Office said. The exact level of fines will be examined during a 12 week consultation following the legislation’s launch on Monday. The spread of fake news and interference in elections will also be tackled.
<br>The need for a new law over a voluntary code has been highlighted by the terrorist attack in New Zealand last month in which 50 Muslims were killed while footage was live-streamed online.

<br>The <strong>16-year-old’s father</strong> demanded a ban on <strong>Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds</strong>, known by the <strong>acronym PUBG</strong>, after <strong>his son hanged himself</strong> from a <strong>ceiling fan</strong> at their <strong>Hyderabad home</strong> following a <strong>reprimand for wasting time</strong> online rather <strong>than studying for an English exam.</strong>&nbsp;<br></p>

Earlier, <strong>Airtel </strong>had launched the 4G Hotspot at a higher price but the introduction of <strong>JioFi</strong> by <strong>Jio</strong> made the telecom operator revise the price of the 4G hotspot and its rental plans. <strong>Airtel</strong> is now offering 4G Wi-Fi hotspot device at <strong>no additional cost </strong>when customers pick an advance rental plan of <strong>six months</strong>.
